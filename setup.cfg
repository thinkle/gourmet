# Note that we're adding our *.gourmet-plugin files to the desktop_files parameter
# of the [build_i18n] section, as they're structured like *.desktop files.
# This requires tricking DistUtilsExtra into installing them into the python
# modules location (given by install_lib) instead of a subdirectory of data_dir,
# as it would normally. We also need to check if setup.py was actually invoked with
# the `install` command in order not to break things when only building gourmet
# (or just *.mo and *.gourmet-plugin files by running `python setup.py build_i18n -m`).

# The below funky syntax is vital for our build_rpms script.
# Each comment between "START NAME" and "END NAME" will be
# stripped at char 2 (in other words, "# " will be removed) and
# setup.py bdist_rpm will be run with those options. This allows
# us to build various rpms with slightly different "requires" as
# required by the myriad incompatible distros (ugh!)
