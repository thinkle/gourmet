# Note that we're adding our *.gourmet-plugin files to the desktop_files parameter
# of the [build_i18n] section, as they're structured like *.desktop files.
# This requires tricking DistUtilsExtra into installing them into the python
# modules location (given by install_lib) instead of a subdirectory of data_dir,
# as it would normally. We also need to check if setup.py was actually invoked with
# the `install` command in order not to break things when only building gourmet
# (or just *.mo and *.gourmet-plugin files by running `python setup.py build_i18n -m`).
