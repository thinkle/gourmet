      <ul>
	<li>Sauce
	  <ul>
	    <li>1 can plum tomatoes (San Marzano preferably)</li>
	    <li>1 stick butter</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>1 lb pasta</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Set water to boil. Melt butter in large saucepan. Add tomatoes.</p>
      <p>Cook tomatoes down on medium heat until reduced by about half. Break up tomatoes with spoon as you go.</p>
      <p>Boil pasta according to normal directions.</p>
      <p>Note: <i>The beauty of this is that everything typically comes out together. It turns out that with a stick of butter, this pasta sauce is to die for, pure and simple. You can fancy it up if you want, but the basic recipe of tomatoes + butter is pretty damned good. Between salted butter and the salt normally in canned tomatoes, this is plenty seasoned, but if you have salt-free butter or low-salt tomatoes, you may need to add salt to taste.</i></p>
