  seeds. Leave stems on. Pat chiles dry with paper towels.
  
  Cut cheese into long thin sticks, one for each chile. Place one stick
  in each chile, using more if chiles are large. If chiles are loose
  and open, wrap around cheese and fasten with wooden picks.
  
  Pour oil 1/4" deep into large skillet. Heat oil to 365 F. Beat egg
  whites in a medium bowl until stiff. Beat egg yolks lightly in a
  small bowl and add all at once to beaten egg whites. Fold lightly but
  thoroughly. Roll chiles in flour, then dip in egg mixture to coat.

  paper towels. Serve immediately topped with tomato sauce.
  
  Tomato Sauce: Combine tomatoes, onion and garlic in blender or food
  pro- cessor; puree. Heat oil in a medium saucepan, add tomato
  mixture. Cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add broth, salt,
  chiles, cloves and cinnamon. Simmer gently 15 minutes.
